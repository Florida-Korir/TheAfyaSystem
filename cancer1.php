        <h2><font color="purple"><b>Cancer Facts</b></font></h2>
        <p>
    Cancer is the <b><font color="orange"> uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells anywhere in a body.</font></b><br>
    There are over 200 types of cancer.<br>
    Anything that may cause a normal body cell to develop abnormally potentially can cause cancer<br>
    Cancer symptoms and signs depend on the specific type and grade of cancer<br>
    Although there are many tests to screen and presumptively diagnose cancer, the definite diagnosis is made by examination of a biopsy sample of suspected cancer tissue.<br>
    Treatment protocols vary according to the type and stage of the cancer. Most treatment protocols are designed to fit the individual patient's disease.<br>
    There are <b> many listed home remedies and alternative treatments for cancers</b> but patients are strongly recommended to discuss these before use with their cancer doctors.<br>
    Plastics may leach chemicals if they're scratched or heated hence may cause cancer as they contain the chemical bisphenol A (BPA).<br>
