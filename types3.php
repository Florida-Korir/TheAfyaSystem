        <h1><font color="navy"><b>Types of cardiovascular diseases $ symptoms</b></font></h1>
      <h1>1.  ARRHYTHMIA</h1><br>
Arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat. There are several ways in which a heartbeat can lose its regular rhythm. These include:<br>
• tachycardia, when the heart beats too fast <br>
• bradycardia, when the heart beats too slowly<br>
• premature ventricular contractions, or additional, abnormal beats<br>
• fibrillation, when the heartbeat is irregular<br>
Arrhythmias occur when the electrical impulses in the heart that coordinate the heartbeat do not work properly making the heart beat in a way it should not. Arrhythmias can become fatal.<br>
        <h1>2. CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE</h1><br>
This is a general term for some deformities of the heart that have been present since birth. Examples include:<br>
• Septal defects: There is a hole between the two chambers of the heart.<br>
• Obstruction defects: The flow of blood through various chambers of the heart is partially or totally blocked.<br>
• Cyanotic heart disease: A defect in the heart causes a shortage of oxygen around the body.<br>


 <h1>3.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE</h1><br>
The coronary arteries supply the heart muscle with nutrients and oxygen by circulating blood. Coronary arteries can become diseased or damaged, usually because of plaque deposits that contain cholesterol. Plaque buildup narrows the coronary arteries, and this causes the heart to receive less oxygen and nutrients.<br>

 <h1>4.  DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY</h1><br>
The heart chambers become dilated as a result of heart muscle weakness and cannot pump blood properly. The most common reason is that not enough oxygen reaches the heart muscle, due to coronary artery disease. This usually affects the left ventricle.<br>
 <h1>5.  MYOCARDIAL I NFARCTION</h1><br>
This is also known as a heart attack, cardiac infarction and coronary thrombosis. An interrupted blood flow damages or destroys part of the heart muscle. This is usually caused by a blood clot that develops in one of the coronary arteries and can also occur if an artery suddenly narrows or spasms.<br>
 <h1>6.  HEART FAILURE</h1><br>
Also known as congestive heart failure, occurs when the heart does not pump blood around the body efficiently. The left or right side of the heart might be affected. Rarely, both sides are. Coronary artery disease or high blood pressure can, over time, leave the heart too stiff or weak to fill and pump properly.<br>


 <h1>7.  HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY</h1> <br>
This is a genetic disorder in which the wall of the left ventricle thickens, making it harder for blood to be pumped out of the heart. This is the leading cause of sudden death in athletes. A parent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to their children.<br>
 <h1>8.  MITRAL REGURGITATION </h1><br>
Also known as mitral valve regurgitation, mitral insufficiency or mitral incompetence. This occurs when the mitral valve in the heart does not close tightly enough. This allows blood to flow back into the heart when it should leave. As a result, blood cannot move through the heart or the body efficiently. People with this type of heart condition often feel tired and out of breath.<br>
 <h1>9.  MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE</h1><br> 
The valve between the left atrium and left ventricle does not fully close, it bulges upwards, or back into the atrium. In most people, the condition is not life-threatening, and no treatment is required. Some people, especially if the condition is marked by mitral regurgitation, may require treatment.<br>
 <h1>10. PULMONARY STENOSIS </h1><br>
It becomes hard for the heart to pump blood from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery because the pulmonary valve is too tight. The right ventricle has to work harder to overcome the obstruction. An infant with severe stenosis can turn blue. Older children will generally have no symptoms. Treatment is needed if the pressure in the right ventricle is too high, and a balloon valvuloplasty or open-heart surgery may be performed to clear an obstruction.<br>

               <h1> Symptoms: </h1><br>
Symptoms depend on which condition is affecting an individual.
However, common symptoms include:<br>
<h4>• Chest pain;</h4> the one common to many types of heart diseases is known as angina or angina pectoris and occurs when part of the heart does not receive enough oxygen. Angina can be triggered by stressful events or physical exertion and normally lasts under 10 minutes.<br>
<h4>• Breathlessness<br></h4>
<h4>• Heart palpitations<br></h4>
Heart attacks can also occur as a result of different types of heart disease. The signs of a heart attack are similar to angina except that they can occur during rest and tend to be more severe. Symptoms of a heart attack can sometimes resemble indigestion, heartburn and a stomach ache can occur, as well as a heavy feeling in the chest. Other symptoms of a heart attack include:<br>
<h4>• pain that travels through the body</h4>, for example from the chest to the arms, neck, back, abdomen, or jaw<br>
<h4>• lightheadedness and dizzy sensations<br></h4>
<h4>• profuse sweating,</h4> nausea and vomiting<br></h4>
Heart failure is also an outcome of heart disease, and breathlessness can occur when the heart becomes too weak to circulate blood. The term ‘congenital heart disease’ covers a range of conditions, but the general symptoms include:<br>
<h4>• sweating</h4>                                                      <h4>chest pain</h4>
<h4>• high levels of fatigue</h4>                                   <h4>a blue tint to the skin</h4> 
<h4>• fast heartbeat and breathing</h4>                         <h4>clubbed fingernails</h4>
<h4>• breathlessness</h4>
