    People with type 1 diabetes require daily insulin treatment, regular blood glucose monitoring and a healthy lifestyle to manage their condition effectively.<br>
	<h1>Insulin</h1><br>
All people with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin to control their blood glucose levels. There are different types of insulin depending on how quickly they work, when they peak and how long they last. Insulin is commonly delivered with a syringe, insulin pen or insulin pump.
Types of insulin include:<br>
•	<h1>Rapid-acting</h1>: usually taken just before or with a meal. These insulins act very quickly to limit the rise in blood sugar, which follows eating. It is essential to avoid over dosage to minimize the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Rapid-acting insulins include Asparat, Glulisine and Lispro.<br>
•	<h1>Short-acting</h1> { Regular or Neutral}: usually taken before meals. They do not act as quickly as rapid-acting insulins and therefore may be more appropriate in certain people. Short-acting insulins include Actrapid, Humulin R and Insuman Rapid.
•	<h1>Intermediate-acting</h1>: often taken together with a short-acting insulin. Intermediate-acting insulins start to act within the first hour of injecting, followed by a period of peak activity lasting up to 7 hours. Intermediate acting insulins include Humulin NPH, Protaphane and Insulatard.<br>
•	<h1>Long-acting</h1>: insulins that are steadily released and can last in the body for up to 24 hours. They are commonly taken in the morning or in the evening before going to bed. Long-acting insulins include Detemir and Glargine.
Two common insulin treatment plans include:<br>
•	<h1>Twice-daily insulin</h1>: using both short-acting and intermediate-acting insulin.<br>
•	<h1>Basal bolus regimen</h1>: short-acting insulin taken with main meals (usually three times a day) and intermediate-acting insulin given once or twice daily (evening or morning and evening).<br>
b.	<h1>Self-monitoring</h1><br>
People with diabetes who require insulin need to check their blood glucose levels regularly to inform insulin dosage. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SBMG) is the name given to the process of blood glucose testing by people with diabetes at home, school, work or elsewhere. SMBG helps people with diabetes and their healthcare providers understand how their blood glucose levels vary during the day so that their treatment can be adjusted accordingly. People with type 1 diabetes are usually advised to measure their blood glucose level at least four times a day. <br>
c.	<h1>Healthy nutrition</h1><br>
Healthy nutrition, knowing what and when to eat, is an important part of diabetes management as different foods affect your blood glucose levels differently. A healthy diet for all people with diabetes includes reducing the amount of calories if you are overweight, replacing saturated fats (e.g. cream, cheese and butter) with unsaturated fats (e.g. avocado, nuts, olive and vegetable oils), eating dietary fiber (e.g. fruit, vegetables and whole grains) and avoiding tobacco use, excessive alcohol and added sugar.<br>
d.	<h1>Physical activity</h1><br>
Regular physical activity is essential to help keep blood glucose levels under control. It is most effective when it includes a combination of both aerobic (e.g. jogging, swimming, cycling) exercise and resistance training, as well as reducing the amount of time spent being inactive.<br>
The cornerstone of managing type 2 diabetes is a healthy lifestyle, which includes a healthy diet, regular physical activity, not smoking, and maintaining a healthy body weight. Regular physical activity is essential to help keep blood glucose levels under control. <br>
Over time, a healthy lifestyle may not be enough to keep blood glucose levels under control and people with type 2 diabetes may need to take oral medication. If treatment with a single medication is not sufficient, combination therapy options may be prescribed.<br>
When oral medication is not sufficient to control blood glucose levels, people with type 2 diabetes may require insulin injections.<br>

<h1>Medications for type 2 diabetes;</h1><br>
•	Metformin: reduces insulin resistance and allows the body to use its own insulin more effectively. It is regarded as the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes in most guidelines around the world.<br>
•	Sulfonylureas: stimulate the pancreas to increase insulin production. Sulfonylureas include gliclazide, glipizide, glimepiride, tolbutamide and glibenclamide.<br>
