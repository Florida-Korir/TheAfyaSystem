Symptoms of angiosarcoma can look like a skin infection, a lesion or a bruise that does not heal. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy are the methods of treatment for angiosarcoma.
<h2><br>Bladder Cancer<br></h2>
Bladder cancer comprises about 5% of all new cancers in the United States, and although it is more common in men than women, incidence rates have been declining. If you or someone you know has bladder cancer, it helps to know the most common signs and symptoms, as well as risk factors, the best path to diagnosis, and how to manage your treatment options.
<h2><br>Bone Cancer<br></h2>
Bone cancer is a term that refers to many different kinds of cancer. Some are rare and some, like Ewingâ€™s sarcoma and osteosarcoma, are most likely to occur in children and teens. Learn about the many different kinds of bone cancer, including risks and symptoms, as well as treatment and the latest statistics on survivorship.
<h2><br>Brain Cancer<br></h2>
There are many different kinds of brain cancer. Malignant brain cancers tend to spread quickly. Learn more about the latest on brain cancer, including risks, symptoms, treatment options, and how to find a specialist.
<h2><br>Brain Tumor<br></h2>
Brain tumors can be malignant or non-malignant. The prognosis for and recovery rates for brain tumors depend on age, size of the tumor, and when it was diagnosed. Learn more about the many different types of brain tumor, including statistics on survival.

<h2><br>DCIS<br></h2>
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the most common type of noninvasive breast cancer in women, where abnormal cells are found in the lining of the breast milk duct. With DCIS, the cancer cells are inside the milk ducts and have not spread in to the fatty breast tissue or to any other part of the body. Treatment for DCIS includes lumpectomy with radiation therapy and mastectomy.
<h2><br>Lymphoma<br></h2>
Lymphoma also termed as lymphatic cancer affects white blood cells known as lymphocytes, the cells that regulates immune system. Symptoms are usually enlargement of lymph nodes, often in the neck, groin, abdomen or armpits. Two main types of lymphoma include hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can occur in both children as well as adults.
<h2><br>Liver Cancer<br></h2>
Liver cancer, also known as hepatic cancer happens when normal cells in the liver become abnormal in their appearance and behavior. The exact cause of liver cancer is unknown but is generally associated with damage and scarring of the liver known as cirrhosis. Treatment for liver cancer includes surgery and liver transplant.

The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist that are located behind your abdominal organs, with one kidney on each side of your spine. Kidney cancer (also called renal cancer) is a disease in which kidney cells become malignant and begin to grow out of control, forming a tumor rarely causing signs or symptoms in its early stages.
