        <h4><font color="green"><b>What is Cancer?</b></font></h4>
         <p>
                	Cancer is the name given to a collection of related diseases.Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.<br>
                	When cancer develops, however, this orderly process breaks down. As cells become more and more abnormal, old or damaged cells survive when they should die, and new cells form when they are not needed. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form growths called tumors.
                </p>  

                 <p>One important difference is that cancer cells are less specialized than normal cells. That is, whereas normal cells mature into very distinct cell types with specific functions, cancer cells do not. This is one reason that, unlike normal cells, cancer cells continue to divide without stopping.<br>
                  In addition, cancer cells are able to ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or that begin a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which the body uses to get rid of unneeded cells.Cancer is a genetic disease that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function. As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur. Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic changes.
