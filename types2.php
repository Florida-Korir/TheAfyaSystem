        <h2><font color="navy"><b>Types of C.R.I $ symptoms</b></font></h2>
    Types of respiratory illness:
<h1>1.  ASTHMA</h1>
Asthma is a common, chronic respiratory condition that causes difficulty breathing due to inflammation of the airways. Symptoms include 
• dry cough, 
• wheezing, 
• chest tightness and shortness of breath.
 There is a major connection between environmental allergies and asthma. Allergic reactions, infections and pollution can all trigger an asthma attack. Those with asthma need to have a rescue inhaler to open airways quickly. 
<h1>2.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY</h1>
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an umbrella term that encompasses several respiratory illnesses that cause breathlessness, or the inability to exhale normally. People usually experience symptoms, including shortness of breath, and normally cough up sputum (mucus from the lungs), especially in the morning. COPD can be tricky for some people to identify, because symptoms are often mistaken for the gradual aging process and body deterioration. In fact, it can develop over the course of several years without any signs of shortness of breath.  It is generally associated with cigarette smoking.
Treatment includes smoking cessation, bronchodilator therapy (medication that opens the airways) and pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a supervised exercise program for people with COPD. 



<h1>3.  CHRONIC BRONCHITIS</h1>
Chronic bronchitis is a form of COPD emphasized by a chronic cough. Usually people cough up sputum (mucus from the lungs), especially in the morning because mucus glands in the airways increase output, and patients have to cough that extra secretion out. It is treated in the same way as COPD. 
<h1>4.  EMPHYSEMA</h1>
Emphysema is a serious respiratory disease, which is another form of COPD. The most common cause is smoking. Those who suffer from emphysema have trouble exhaling air from their lungs. Cigarette smoke damages the air sacs in the lungs to a point where they can no longer repair themselves. Emphysema evolves slowly over the years, and there is no cure; however, those who quit smoking are more likely to see the disease’s progression slow.
<h1>5.  LUNG CANCER</h1>
With the ability to develop in any part of the lungs, this cancer is difficult to detect. Most often, the cancer develops in the main part of the lungs near the air sacs. DNA mutations in the lungs cause irregular cells to multiply and create an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells, or a tumor. These tumors interfere with the regular functions of the lungs.
The most common risk factor for lung cancer is cigarette smoke. Other risk factors include radon exposure, workplace exposure, including asbestos and diesel fumes, secondhand smoke, air pollution and radiation exposure from frequent CT scans of the chest.
Symptoms can take years to appear, but include things like
• chronic coughing, 
• changes in voice,
•  harsh breathing sounds and 
• coughing up blood.


<h1>6.  CYSTIC FIBROSIS/BRONCHIECTASIS</h1>
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic respiratory disease caused by a defective gene that creates thick and sticky mucus that clogs up tubes and passageways. This mucus causes repeat, and dangerous, lung infections, as well as obstructions in the pancreas that prevent important enzymes from breaking down nutrients for the body. Symptoms of cystic fibrosis include: 
• salty-tasting skin, 
• chronic coughing, 
• frequent lung infections 
•  poor growth rate in children.
People who have cystic fibrosis will also develop bronchiectasis, which is a condition in which patients develop abnormally dilated bronchial tubes. This allows mucus to pool, causing frequent respiratory tract infections, wheezing and shortness of breath. There are other ways bronchiectasis develops besides cystic fibrosis, including other infections. Bronchiectasis usually develops later in life and is more common in women than men.
<h1>7.  PNEUMONIA</h1>
Pneumonia is a common lung disease caused by an infection in the air sacs in the lungs. The infections can be bacterial, viral or fungal. Most people can recover in one to three weeks but for certain people, pneumonia can be extremely serious and even life-threatening.
Patients can be at increasingly susceptible to pneumonia, based on their smoking history or just their overall immune status. If they are frail or sickly, they can develop pneumonia more readily than young, healthy, well-nourished people.
Symptoms, which include cough, fever, shaking chills and shortness of breath, can range from mild to severe. 
<h1>8.  PLEURAL EFFUSION</h1>
Pleural effusion is a collection of fluid between the lung and the chest wall in the pleural space. The fluid can collect for a variety of reasons, including pneumonia, cancer or congestive heart failure. Usually patients notice symptoms of increasing chest discomfort and shortness of breath. Patients usually undergo a procedure to remove the fluid, which allows the lung to re-expand, allowing the patient to breathe better. Then, the fluid is tested to determine what’s causing it and a treatment plan is formed.
