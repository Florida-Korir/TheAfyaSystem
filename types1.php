        <h2><font color="navy"><b>Types of diabetes $ symptoms</b></font></h2>
       <h1>1. TYPE 1 DIABETES  </h1>
Around 10% of all people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction where the body’s defense system attacks the cells that produce insulin. As a result, the body produces very little or no insulin. Type 1 diabetes can affect people at any age, but usually develops in children or young adults. People with type 1 diabetes need daily injections of insulin to control their blood glucose levels. If people with type 1 diabetes do not have access to insulin, they will die.
<h3>Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include;</h3>
• Abnormal thirst and dry mouth<br>
• Sudden weight loss<br>
• Frequent urination<br>
• Lack of energy, tiredness<br>
• Constant hunger<br>
• Blurred vision<br>
• Bedwetting<br>
<h1>2. TYPE 2 DIABETES</h1>
This is the most common type of diabetes, accounting for around 90% of all diabetes cases. It is generally characterized by insulin resistance, where the body does not fully respond to insulin. Because insulin cannot work properly, blood glucose levels keep rising, releasing more insulin. For some people with type 2 diabetes this can eventually exhaust the pancreas, resulting in the body producing less and less insulin, causing even higher blood sugar levels (hyperglycaemia). It is most commonly diagnosed in older adults but is increasingly seen in children, adolescents and younger adults due to rising levels of obesity, physical inactivity and poor diet.
The cornerstone of type 2 diabetes management is a healthy diet, increased physical activity and maintaining a healthy body weight. Oral medication and insulin are also frequently prescribed to help control blood glucose levels. Changes in diet and physical activity related to rapid development and urbanization have led to sharp increases in the numbers of people living with type 2 diabetes. 
<h3>Symptoms of type 2 diabetes;</h3>
The symptoms of type 2 diabetes are similar to those of type 1 diabetes and include:
• Excessive thirst and dry mouth
• Frequent urination
• Lack of energy, tiredness
• Slow healing wounds
• Recurrent infections in the skin
• Blurred vision
• Tingling or numbness in hands and feet.
These symptoms can be mild or absent and so people with type 2 diabetes may live several years with the condition before being diagnosed.
<h1>3. GESTATIONAL DIABETES</h1>
Gestational diabetes is associated with multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women with gestational diabetes are at subsequent high risk of type 2 diabetes, especially three to six years after delivery. Exposure to hyperglycaemia in the womb predisposes children to a high risk of becoming overweight or obese, associated with the development of type 2 diabetes.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a severe and neglected threat to maternal and child health. Many women with GDM experience pregnancy-related complications including high blood pressure, large birth weight babies and obstructed labour. Approximately half of women with a history of GDM go on to develop type 2 diabetes within five to ten years after delivery. The prevalence of high blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) in pregnancy increases rapidly with age and is highest in women over the age of 45. 
It is important for women with diabetes in pregnancy or GDM to carefully control and monitor their blood glucose levels to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes with the support of their healthcare provider.
